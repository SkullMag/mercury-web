## Why "Mercury"? 
In my trip to the USA I have bought the book "Cosmic Queries" written by Neil deGrasse Tyson. However, my mother tongue is Russian, 
so I have to look up some words. This book has liven my curiosity, so I decided to name the application "Mercury" as Mercury is a nearest planet to the Sun
and for me it represents curiosity of mankind.
